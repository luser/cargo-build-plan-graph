https://luser.github.io/cargo-build-plan-graph/

A page to visualize cargo build graph output as a Gantt chart.

Experimentally you can use the `add-timings.py` script to use profile information from a cargo build (using a custom cargo built [from this branch](https://github.com/luser/cargo/tree/profile-build-steps)) to add timings from a real build to the chart.
